# Appointments and Reminders

This is a React.js application that allows users to manage appointments and set reminders. Users can input appointment details, including the title, date, time, and description. Reminders are set based on the appointments' dates and times and will trigger an alert when the time matches.

## Features

> Add new appointments with titles, dates, times, and descriptions.
> Set reminders based on the appointments' dates and times.
> Toggle appointments as "Starred" to filter them.
> Automatically receive alerts for appointments that match the current date and time.

Sunitha can be monitored using both hardware and software:

Use case: 
A smart home system that can help Sunita Sharma live a healthier and better life.

Technology: 
The smart home system would use a variety of sensors and devices to monitor Sunita's health and well-being,
including:
>Motion sensors to track her movement around the house
>Door and window sensors to detect if she leaves the house or opens a window
>Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors to alert her to fire or gas leaks
>Temperature sensors to monitor the temperature in her home
>Light sensors to turn lights on and off automatically
>Medication dispensers to remind her to take her medication

Benefits: 
The smart home system would provide Sunita with a number of benefits, 

Increased safety: 
>The motion sensors and door/window sensors would help to ensure that Sunita is safe in her home. If she falls or if there is a fire, the system would alert her family or caregivers.
Improved health:
>The temperature sensors, light sensors, and medication dispensers would help to keep Sunita healthy. The system would also be able to track her vital signs and send alerts to her doctor if there are any concerns.
Increased independence: 
>The smart home system would allow Sunita to live independently for longer. She would be able to control her home with voice commands or a remote control, and she would not have to worry about forgetting to take her medication or turning off the lights.

Here are some additional ideas for improving the system:

>The system could be integrated with a video chat service so that Sunita can stay connected with her family and friends.
>The system could be used to provide Sunita with reminders for appointments, birthdays, and other important events.
>The system could be used to control other devices in Sunita's home, such as the TV, thermostat, and lights.
>I am excited to explore these ideas and to create a working prototype of this smart home system. I believe that it has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of elderly people.
